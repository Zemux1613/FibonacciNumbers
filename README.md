## Introduction

If you have the wierd wish to know more about the fibonnacci series here are some facts. The fibonacci series was named after the Italian [Leonardo Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci) (*1170 - â€ 1240). Leonardo Fibonacci develop the serie to have a formular to growing of a rabbitpopulation. The awsome on the series is that after many times of research from a lot of scientist found out that the series represent a lot of natual growth processes. 

The important 3 facts of the fibonacci series are the following:
- natual growing is following an addition rule because the relation to the predecessor and successor of a special sequence member.
- The fibonacci series have a direct context to the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio). 
- This approximation is alternating, that is, the quotients are smaller and larger than the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

The recursive formation rule is the following:

The explicid formation rule is the following:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}&space;{f_n}&space;=&space;\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\begin{bmatrix}{(\frac{1&plus;\sqrt{5}}{2})}^{n}&space;-&space;{\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}}^{n}&space;&space;\\\end{bmatrix}" title="{f_n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\begin{bmatrix}{(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})}^{n} - {\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}}^{n} \\\end{bmatrix}" />
